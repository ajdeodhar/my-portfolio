  summary: `I’m a junior in Computer Engineering with a strong interest in data-driven problem solving. I enjoy working with software, data, and analytics — whether that means building real-time dashboards, modeling complex systems, or diving into datasets to uncover meaningful insights. My background spans Python, SQL, MATLAB, JavaScript, HTML/CSS and C, and I’m especially drawn to projects where I can apply data science and machine learning techniques to solve real-world problems. In addition, my coursework in Computer Engineering has given me exposure to concepts in hardware design, computer architecture, and embedded systems, providing a solid understanding of how the underlying systems work. This is where I’m sharing what I’ve been working on and where I’m heading next.

Most recently, I completed a capstone project during my data analytics internship at Ganit, where I built a Python pipeline to fetch and store a full year of historical currency exchange data using the Frankfurter API, performed EDA to uncover market trends, and developed a Tableau dashboard to present the insights.

In parallel, I’ve applied machine learning models like XGBoost, Linear Regression, and Random Forest on a large healthcare dataset to estimate diabetes risk. I’m also exploring edge AI and computer vision — including a helmet detection system using ResNet18 on cropped image regions, and a YOLOv5-based bottle counting tool using annotated object datasets.

As part of my work with Simulytics, I contributed to internal product demo preparation by designing and updating MS SQL Server tables (SKU Master, UoM Master, Bin Master, etc.) to simulate warehouse management operations. I also developed a custom FastAPI-based email service to automatically send real-time alert emails with embedded charts and PDF attachments. In addition, I worked on integrating the Gupshup WhatsApp API for end-to-end messaging, helping close the communication loop in the internal product flow.

Earlier, during my internship at Techlore, I developed a user interface to visualize optimized logistics routes using linear programming. The system integrated Lindo API with JavaScript and HTML/CSS to generate optimal network flows for cost-effective delivery paths. This experience sparked my appreciation for mathematical optimization and decision-support systems in real-world operations.`,
